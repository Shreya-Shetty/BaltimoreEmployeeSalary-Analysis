The data sets I chose are related to employee salaries of Baltimore city for the years 2016-2019.

The URLs to access the datasets:
2019: https://query.data.world/s/wrxyalft7tm2qlg7soxjv75tw5a26o
2018: https://query.data.world/s/kxh2l22bf3id3uj2uutljvwzcbfhv6
2017: https://query.data.world/s/mfg4mszxwdgs4qw7m2kjmqq5wpdw7x
2016: https://query.data.world/s/bbh4zuwcfl6ugi2iahvh5m74sqrbik
The data is free to download, and I did not violate any terms of service. The data has employee details like name, designation, hired date and salary. After combining the 4 datasets Iâ€™ll be able to analyze data of four consecutive years containing salaries of employees. By doing this I can closely observe the small changes in professions. Also, I can see the consistency of employee count in each field.
